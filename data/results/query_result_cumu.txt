It is possible to receive a PhD degree at Constructor University based on a cumulation of articles under the following conditions:  The articles need to be framed by an introduction (that develops the larger theoretical context of the Thesis), a discussion and a common thread that is leading through the different papers.  The number and status (published, accepted, submitted) of articles necessary is decided upon by the Dissertation Committee.  The student must submit, as an integral part of the Thesis, a “Statement on Contribution” defining his/her contribution to each article along with the PhD Thesis.

The “Statement on Contribution” must also contain title, coauthors, journal, status, and date of submission/acceptance (if applicable). With his/her signature the student Policies for PhD Studies 7 |v1.5 (2023‐02‐01) declares that all coauthors and the PhD Advisor agree with the information given in the “Statement on Contribution”.  Only articles with significant contributions of the candidate may be added to thecumulative PhD Thesis. Exceptions from this rule need acceptance by the Dissertation Committee.  Upon submission of a cumulative PhD Thesis the student must insure that the thesis does not contain any infringement of rights of third parties.

 Only articles with significant contributions of the candidate may be added to the cumulative PhD Thesis. Exceptions from this rule need acceptance by the Dissertation Committee.  Upon submission of a cumulative PhD Thesis the student must insure that the thesis does not contain any infringement of rights of third parties. With respect to all claims made by third parties against Constructor Univ ersity for infringement of their rights by the thesis, the student will indemnify Constructor University against such claims at first request, including the necessary costs of legal defense. Prior to the publication of the PhD Thesis the PhD student must submit “Declarations of Consent” of all coauthors.

For the publication possibilities listed above, all changes requested by the Dissertation Committee must be included prior to the publication of the PhD Thesis. The Chair of the Dissertation Committee ensures that this requirement is met and approves by signing the “Signature Sheet for the Conferral of the D egree” before the PhD Thesis can be published. Additionally, before publishing a cumulative Ph D Thesis with the IRC, the student must hand in a copy of the “Statement on Contribution”. For each article that is not yet published at the time of submission for publication of the PhD thesis, the PhD student must hand in a copy of the “Declaration of Consent” for each coauthor of the article. The introduction, the discussion and all articles that are not yet published at the time of the submission of the PhD Thesis must be publishe d through the IRC.
